# Rock Paper Scissors algorithms!
RPSalgorithms is a program that showcases different Rock Paper Scissors algorithms I've come up with. Have fun testing out the different bots and maybe you might discover some secrets along the way.

## Dependencies

## TODO:  
 - Add more images for variety (low priority)  
 - More eastereggs  
 - Add more bots (here you can help)
 - TOURNAMENT MODE! All the bots will be able to fight eachother one after one to see who gets the highest score, here you can change what gives points, so maybe to win the tournament, you need to lose the most or get the most ties? There will also be a classic tournament mode where the bots fight in brackets and the one who loses the most out of 'n' rounds gets eliminated, pretty much a normal tournament!
